# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor - Accessibility Home Work

## Description
An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business—for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Accessibility can include complex requirements, these criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.
